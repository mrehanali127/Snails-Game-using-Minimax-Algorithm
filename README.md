## Two player game (Human vs Bot) in Python
### Overview
In this era there is strong competition between video games because it seems that now people spend 
most of their time on video games rather than domestic ones. Now its trend of machine-human games 
means machine will play with human with same intelligence and compete very wisely. But this is challenge 
for developers to make machine enough much intelligent so that it can compete human. Here AI comes 
to make machine intelligent as we know today AI is buzz word every man talking about AI in this project 
you will taste its one flavor that is AI for Games. We have developed a turn-based AI game which we give 
named as “Snails”. Snails is two players turn based games. In which one player will be human and other 
will be Bot (AI agent). It is Grid Based game. Its winning criteria to occupy as many boxes as possible more 
than opponent. We will discuss its complete working later. 
### Programming Language:
This game is design and implemented in Python3 a general-purpose programming language. You have to install python environment first.
### Libraries:
Arcade is used for make an interactive user interface for game. Arcade has many powerful functions to develop 2D games. We have used this one because it is easy to integrate with Python3.
